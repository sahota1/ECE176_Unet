# ECE176_Unet
In this project, we reimplement the U-net architecture originally presented in Ronneberger et al.. Our implementation is tested on the MBRSC dataset, which contains aerial imagery of Dubai. Our experiments tested the performance of the architecture with varying approaches to implementation, initialization, and training.

We experimented with different hyperparameters to optimize for this dataset and were able to achieve 50% IoU with some of the best models.

Please look at the file Report.pdf for more details.
